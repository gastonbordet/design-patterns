## Strategy pattern

Let's say you have a class that performs a certain task, and you want to implement different variations of that task. Instead of modifying the class to add new functionality, you can create a set of strategy classes that each implements a different variation of the task. You can then pass one of these strategy objects to the class at runtime, which uses it to perform the task in the desired way.

To use the strategy pattern in programming, you would typically follow these steps:

    - Identify the behavior that varies across different classes or objects.

    - Define an interface that encapsulates the behavior and the methods that will be used by the context object.
    
    - Implement one or more concrete classes that implement the interface.
    
    - Modify the context object to accept a strategy object as a parameter or inject it via dependency injection.
    
    - In the context object, use the strategy object to perform the behavior, rather than implementing the behavior directly.

Overall, the strategy pattern is useful when you have multiple variations of a task or behavior that you want to implement in a flexible and extensible way. It promotes encapsulation, modularity, and flexibility, making your code easier to maintain and modify over time.
